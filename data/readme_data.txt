Data

This includes a file used for plotting timescales, as well as separate folders for fungal and algal data. The algal folder then contains separate folders for analyses, with an alignment file included in the RAxML folder.  A .csv file also includes the taxonomy, and whether the isolate is lichen-forming (1) or not (0). The fungi folder contains separate folders for individual analyses, which include .csv files, alignments and tree files.

Files directly within the fungi and algae folders are .csv files that contain information on the taxa included, and their character state (fungi: 0=non-lichenized and 1=lichenized, OR 0=non-lichenized, 1=lichenized with trebouxiophycean algae, 2=lichenized with trentepohlialean algae or 3=lichenized with cyanobacterial algae; algae: 0=non-lichenized and 1=lichenized). The four state coding scheme was used only for visualization purposes in Figure 2 of the main manuscript.

The algae folder contains separate folders for the BEAST analyses (beast) and ML analyses (raxml). The raxml folder contains the alignment (infile.txt), partition file used (part.txt) and ML tree with bootstrap values (RAxML_bipartitions.result).  The beast folder contains the mcc tree (mcc.med.hts.tre) and the 40,000 post-burnin trees (resamp40k.tre).

The fungi folder contains separate folders for the files used in the comparative dating analysis (restricted_ascomycota) and the more densely-sampled dataset and files used in the ancestral state reconstruction and to estimate the age of LFF (dense_ascomycota). Subfolders are included in the restricted_ascomycota folder for BEAST and RAxML analyses. The dense_ascomycota folder contains five subfolders.  The first, raxml_dense, includes the alignment (FUSED_21july2014.phy), partition file (concat_partfile_21july2014.txt) and the ML tree, bootstrap-derived topologies, and the ML tree with bootstrap values plotted (bipartitions).  The remaining four folders contain files associated with the different ways in which trees were dated.  These contain substantial files in some cases, including summaries of individual corHMM analyses xxx_corhmm_results.csv (including AIC values and individual parameter estimates), as well as a separate set of files (corhmm_summary_xxx.csv) that includes summaries of which model was preferred and the numbers and ages of character state transitions. In the bootstrap analyses, a summary of the number of transitions and their ages is included directly within this folder, and the "results" file is placed in a folder named results_aicc, while individual trees are included in folder named trees. Trees are named by the tree (ML or tree derived from an individual bootstrap replicate), followed by the BEAST analysis sample number that was used to timescale the tree.  The files associated with the boots_timescaled_w_sample are numerous, and include two files for each of the 100 bootstrap replicate (each containing results from 25 separate time-scalings).  These could be concatenated into a single file for viewing, but were deliberately not combined to enable others to replicate the downstream analyses we conducted.
